# Organisation

The Data Chapter is a nonprofit organisation that works for our
members interest. We have by-laws and a board of directors – and a lot of documents. At first hand we follow the Swedish laws as a non-profit organisation. We also follow to the KTH Student Union bylaws,
rules and white paper.

The Data Chapter also have their own white paper. To regulate our own activities we got our **[by-laws](https://styrdokument.datasektionen.se/stadgar)** and our volunteers
**[rules](https://styrdokument.datasektionen.se/reglemente)**.

### Members

Members are everyone who pays the chapter fee. The board of directors are members,
the volunteers are members and we hope that you are a member! Every
member are allowed to attend and vote at the chapter meetings(SM).

### Clubs

[Here is a picture describing our organization](https://static.datasektionen.se/organisation/karta-2017-01-31.jpg)

A club is an organisational entity created for a specific purpose. One of our clubs monitors our study environment, another takes care of the sektionslokal, another arrange parties and so forth. Every club has a chairman that is elected at the SM. How you become member of a club varies from which club it is. Some clubs has a limit to how many members they bring in and some have
interviews. If you want to know more a bout a certain club, you are welcome to contact the club's chairman!\
If you want to create your own club you write a motion and send it to the board of directors. Then all members votes if your proposal should pass. You should make a budget, a description of your activities and possibly formulate by-laws/rules.

It's also possible to make a project in the chapter. A project is similar to a temporary club, it is created the same way, with a motion.

### Volunteers

Volunteers are also elected at the SM. Every volunteer is responsible for one club or activity in the chapter. If you want to get engaged in a club or activity you are welcome to turn to its volunteer! If you want to be a volunteer yourself contact [Valberedningen](/sektionen/val) för att kandidera på ett
SM. Information om vad det innebär att vara funktionär finns i denna
[intropholdr](https://static.datasektionen.se/infphldr2016-12-15.pdf).

### Styrelsen

Styrelsen är de personer som medlemmarna utsett att utföra besluten som
fattas på SM. Styrelsen är därmed ansvarig inför alla medlemmar att
besluten följs och att sektioner följer sina stadgar och reglementet,
och självklart även lagen. Datasektionens styrelse består av ordförande,
vice ordförande, kassör, sekreterare och tre ledamöter. Om du själv vill

### Statutory Auditor

The Statutory Auditor is the one that performs audit through verifying the bookkeeping, quorum and activity in an organisation,
e.g. an organisation, an institution or a business. The Data Chapter's Auditor examines  bookkeeping and meeting protocols every year to decide if the board of directors have done their job.  Contact [Valberedningen](/sektionen/val) if you want to become if you want to run for Statutory Auditor on next SM.

### When is everything decided?

If you want to suggest an alteration in the documents you leave a
motion to SM. To change the by-laws it is required two consecutive
SM-decisions.

### Chapter Meeting(Sektionsmöte, SM)

Chapter meeting, or SM, is the chapter's highest decision-making body. Could be compared with the Data Chapter's annual meeting, but there are multiple every year. Every member of the Data Chapter have a right to speak their mind and vote at the SM. All of the most important decisions affecting the chapter are made on the SM. There are four
stated SM in the year; Budget-SM(Budget Meeting), and Glögg-SM(Christmas Meeting), Revisions-SM(Audit meeting) and
Val-SM(Election Meeting) på våren. More chapter meetings could be arranged.

### D-rektorat Meeting (D-rektoratsmöten, DM)

The Board of Directors Meeting. All of the chapter members have the right to attend and only the chairmen have the right to speak their mind. Every volunteer gets an invitation to DM but it's only the D-rektorat's members of the court that are expected to attend. The volunteers and members are welcomebut are not expected to attend if it isn't a specially interesting topic on the agenda.
